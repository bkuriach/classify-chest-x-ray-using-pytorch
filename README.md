Classify Chest X-Ray using PyTorch

1. Create Custom Dataset
   Create a custom dataset by inheriting torch.utils.data.Dataset class and iterate them using torch dataloaders. This can be extended to other datasets as well.

2. Using PytTorch, build a ResNet18 model with pretrained parameters and fine-tune (Transfer Learning) for 
   this use case.
